# Slanty Shanty

This is a mod for Don't Starve Together.
It added a feature originated from the newest DLC of Don't Starve -- Hamlet.

## Recipe

The original recipe in Don't Starve requires 30 oincs to craft Slanty Shanty,
but in Don't Starve Together, you can't acquire oinc in any means,
so I replace the oinc with gold nugget:

```
3x Goldnugget + 4x Boards + 3x Cutstone = Slanty Shanty
```
